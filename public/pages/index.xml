      <description>This website aims to provide an introduction to fundamental data skills needed by researchers, students, learners, government officials, journalists, and the general public in the 21st century.
Data is everywhere and data literacy is becoming an increasingly important skill to have regardless of who you are and what kind of job you do or even whether you&amp;rsquo;re working at all.
What is data literacy? Who developed the content? The website was initially developed in June 2020 for a &amp;ldquo;21st Century Skills for Industry&amp;rdquo; course offered to Nanotechnology Honours students at Rhodes University, South Africa.</description>
