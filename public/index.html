There are two types of data - qualitative and quantitative data.  Qualitative data are used to classify or categorise something. For example one can collect qualitative data about the weather - it is hot, windy, humid, and so forth. One can use qualitative data to classify or categorise something, for example shirts as either small, medium or large.  Quantitative data are numbers. It is 30 degrees Celsius. The barometric pressure in Cape Town is 1017 hPa. We measured 45 mm of rain last night. Quantitative data can either be discreet or continuous.  Discreet data is a count and is measured in full numbers. For example 30 students enrolled for the Data Literacy workshop. We can\u0027t say 30.5 students enrolled. It has to be a full number and will either be 30 or 31, but nothing inbetween.  Continuous data is numerical data that can take on any value in a certain range.     Data can include a wide variety of artefacts including spreadsheets, documents, survey results, digitised texts or other artefacts, images, videos, models, measurements, much much more. Most projects will include more than one data type that often needs to be combined. A project may create data in a laboratory, that is processed, analysed and eventually will be represented in a spreadsheet or as graph in a report.    What kind of data have you encountered before?

							label: "<p> Recognise that data can come from a multitude of sources.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s learn more about the concept of primary and secondary data.\n       Primary data may mean different things depending on your area of expertise. On the one hand, primary data are created or collected for a specific purpose. On the other hand, primary data may refer to original works for example the state of the nation address by President Cyril Ramaphosa.   Secondary data then may refer either to data that was collected by someone else and made available for reuse or it may refer to works that are derived from primary data. An example of a secondary dataset may therefore be the census data available from the national statistics office if it refers to data collected by someone else. Alternatively, a news report about the state of the nation address may be referred to as a derived work and thus be referred to as secondary data.   Internal data are typically data produced within your own research group or company. The data is not necessarily structured and described in a way that others outside of your group will be able to use it.   External data are data collected from elsewhere. It can be from the Internet, other companies, other research groups, social media and so forth.     Where are you going to get data for your own project? Will you use data from your group? Do you have to create your own data?

Below is an excerpt from the publication.  It is generally a good idea to store all of the files relevant to one project under a common root directory. The exception to this rule is source code or scripts that are used in multiple projects. Each such program might have a project directory of its own.

She\u0026rsquo;s not interested in staying in academia, and plans to start applying for industry positions. Lindiwe wants to do a good job of her final research project. At the same time, she\u0026rsquo;s looking to learn some transferrable skills that will make her more employable and will let her application stand out to recruiters.\nDATASKILLS can help Lindiwe learn some fundamental data skills that will help her in her research project, but is also applicable to any position she might likely take up after completing her degree.\n   Greg, a journalist    Greg have heard a lot of talking about story-telling and data journalism. He\u0026rsquo;s seen some fantastic reports about the COVID-19 pandemic with charts that really bring the message accross to readers. He completed his journalism course many years ago - before the curriculum included material on data handling, analysis and visualisation. He now wants to learn to do data-driven story-telling but doesn\u0026rsquo;t know where to start. The courses he\u0026rsquo;s come across all assume some prior knowledge about finding, cleaning, and analysing data.\nDATASKILLS can help Greg learn about where to find data for his story, how the data can be used based on it\u0026rsquo;s licensing, and also point him to some resources about communicating effectively via data visualisation. There are also links to entry level learning materials about free and open-source data analysis and visualisation tools such as R and Python.\n   Prisha, a Psychology masters student    Prisha is busy with her research project. She\u0026rsquo;s developing a survey to learn about people\u0026rsquo;s attitude towards learning to use various data analysis tools. She is busy with her literature review and found a number of existing surveys that seems similar to what she wants to do. She also wants to be able to compare her results with published data from other surveys. Prisha is unsure of how to use the data in her own work. Someone told her about copyright and data licenses, but she\u0026rsquo;s not exactly sure what is allowed and what is considered infringement of copyright.\nDATASKILLS can help Prisha learn how to reuse existing data and how to make her data reusable so that others can build upon her work.\n   Karla, a lecturer and postgraduate student supervisor    Karla is a third year lecturer in the Genomics department. She is aware that their curriculum is outdated and doesn\u0026rsquo;t prepare students for the workplace of today as they hardly include any data literacy training. Most of her students (including herself and most of her colleagues) are a bit scared of all the high-tech data analysis tools that she\u0026rsquo;s heard about at conferences and read about in papers. She can\u0026rsquo;t change the curriculum in the short term, but she want to include a lesson or two on data handling, analysis, and visualisation and want to give her students some references that will help them on their way.\nDATASKILLS can help Karla with accessible materials that she can include in her lesson. As the website is constantly evolving and new material gets added each month, her students can refer back to the site to continue their learning and find materials appropriate for what they need when they need it.\n   Sam, a random citizen    Sam is a random citizen. They\u0026rsquo;ve been watching the COVID-19 statistics and want to do some analysis for their own region based on data they found online. Sam have never worked with a CSV file - the format in which the data can be downloaded. In fact, they\u0026rsquo;re not sure what CSV stands for. They will do most of their analysis in Excel but wants a quick reference about how to start.\nDATASKILLS can provide some information about typical file formats data might come in, explain the pros and cons of various file formats, and explain how to work with the data in a variety of data analysis platforms.\n   </p>",
