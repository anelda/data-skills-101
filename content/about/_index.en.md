title: About this site
---

This website aims to provide an introduction to fundamental data skills needed by researchers, students, learners, government officials, journalists, and the general public in the 21st century. Data is everywhere and data literacy is becoming an increasingly important skill to have regardless of who you are and what kind of job you do or even whether you're working at all.

### Why is data literacy important?

This video by faculty from University of South Florida St. Petersburg explains the need for data literacy training even at undergraduate level.

### Who developed the content?

The website was initially developed in June 2020 for a _"21st Century Skills for Industry"_ course offered to Nanotechnology Honours students at Rhodes University, South Africa. The course coordinator was Heidi Duveskog from [Contextualize](http://contextualize.co.za/). The materials on this website was compiled by [Talarify](http://www.talarify.co.za) with input from Contextualize and team members from [afrimapr](http://afrimapr.org). The material borrows a lot from the "[23 Research Data Things](https://au-research.github.io/ARDC-23-things/researchdata/things/" originally developed by the Australian National Data Service and currently maintained by the [Australian Research Data Commons](https://ardc.edu.au/).
