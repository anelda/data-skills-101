title: About DATASKILLS
---

This website aims to provide an introduction to fundamental data skills needed by researchers, students, learners, government officials, journalists, and the general public in the 21st century. Data is everywhere and data literacy is becoming an increasingly important skill to have regardless of who you are and what kind of job you do or even whether you're working at all.

### What is data literacy and why do we care?

### Who developed the content?

_[DATASKILLS](index.html)_ is an initiative developed by Anelda van der Walt from [Talarify](http://www.talarify.co.za). The project is a culmination of many years' experience in working with a wide variety of data and teaching numerous data and computational literacy courses in Africa and beyond. 

Despite the fact that this project has been in the making for many years, it finally saw the light in June 2020 in response to a request to teach a data module as part of a _"21st Century Skills for Industry"_ course offered to Nanotechnology Honours students at Rhodes University, South Africa. The course coordinator was Heidi Duveskog from [Contextualize](http://contextualize.co.za/). The materials on this website was compiled by [Talarify](http://www.talarify.co.za) with input from Contextualize and team members from [afrimapr](http://afrimapr.org). The material borrows a lot from the "[23 Research Data Things](https://au-research.github.io/ARDC-23-things/researchdata/things/
)" originally developed by the Australian National Data Service and currently maintained by the [Australian Research Data Commons](https://ardc.edu.au/).

Other communities that has had an influence on the style and content of _[DATASKILLS](index.html)_ include [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) and the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.za).
