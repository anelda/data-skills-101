{{< personas "Greg, a journalist" >}}
Greg have heard a lot of talking about story-telling and data journalism. He's seen some fantastic reports about the COVID-19 pandemic with charts that really bring the message accross to readers. He completed his journalism course many years ago - before the curriculum included material on data handling, analysis and visualisation. He now wants to learn to do data-driven story-telling but doesn't know where to start. The courses he's come across all assume some prior knowledge about finding, cleaning, and analysing data.

_[DATASKILLS]( {{< baseurl >}})_ can help Greg learn about where to find data for his story, how the data can be used based on it's licensing, and also point him to some resources about communicating effectively via data visualisation. There are also links to entry level learning materials about free and open-source data analysis and visualisation tools such as R and Python.

{{< personas "Prisha, a Psychology masters student" >}}
Prisha is busy with her research project. She's developing a survey to learn about people's attitude towards learning to use various data analysis tools. She is busy with her literature review and found a number of existing surveys that seems similar to what she wants to do. She also wants to be able to compare her results with published data from other surveys. Prisha is unsure of how to use the data in her own work. Someone told her about copyright and data licenses, but she's not exactly sure what is allowed and what is considered infringement of copyright.

_[DATASKILLS]( {{< baseurl >}})_ can help Prisha learn how to reuse existing data and how to make her data reusable so that others can build upon her work.

{{< personas "Karla, a lecturer and postgraduate student supervisor" >}}
Karla is a third year lecturer in the Genomics department. She is aware that their curriculum is outdated and doesn't prepare students for the workplace of today as they hardly include any data literacy training. Most of her students (including herself and most of her colleagues) are a bit scared of all the high-tech data analysis tools that she's heard about at conferences and read about in papers. She can't change the curriculum in the short term, but she want to include a lesson or two on data handling, analysis, and visualisation and want to give her students some references that will help them on their way.

_[DATASKILLS]( {{< baseurl >}})_ can help Karla with accessible materials that she can include in her lesson. As the website is constantly evolving and new material gets added each month, her students can refer back to the site to continue their learning and find materials appropriate for what they need when they need it.

They will do most of their analysis in Excel but wants a quick reference about how to start.
