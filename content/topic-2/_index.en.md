Data management should be considered even before a project kicks off. In research, it is important to develop a data management plan to consider where data will come from, where it will be stored, how it will be preserved, and how you will share data and communicate to others on the project about the data.

In this section we will look at:

* file naming conventions
* project and data organisation on your computer
* data management plans
* options for storing and sharing data online

  > Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data.
