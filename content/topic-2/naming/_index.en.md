In [File naming conventions: why you want them and how to create them](https://www.huridocs.org/2016/07/file-naming-conventions-why-you-want-them-and-how-to-create-them/) Kristin Antin explains how they have helped to develop file naming conventions for numerous human rights organisations.

> We are passionate about file naming and other information management tactics because the more organised we can be with managing our information, the more effective and efficient we can be in our human rights work.

By implementing file naming conventions in your project - big or small - you can be more effective and efficient too!
