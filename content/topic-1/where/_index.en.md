  <strong>Primary data</strong> may mean different things depending on your area of expertise. On the one hand, primary data are created or collected for a specific purpose. On the other hand, primary data may refer to original works for example the state of the nation address by President Cyril Ramaphosa.

  <strong>Secondary data</strong> then may refer either to data that was collected by someone else and made available for reuse or it may refer to works that are derived from primary data. An example of a secondary dataset may therefore be the census data available from the national statistics office if it refers to data collected by someone else. Alternatively, a news report about the state of the nation address may be referred to as a derived work and thus be referred to as secondary data.

  <strong>Internal data</strong> are typically data produced within your own research group or company. The data is not necessarily structured and described in a way that others outside of your group will be able to use it.

  <li>
  <strong>External data</strong> are data collected from elsewhere. It can be from the Internet, other companies, other research groups, social media and so forth.
