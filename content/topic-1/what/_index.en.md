  Data are collections of facts. There are two types of data - qualitative and quantitative data.
  <br><br>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Qualitative data</strong> are used to classify or categorise something. For example one can collect qualitative data about the weather - it is hot, windy, humid, and so forth. One can use qualitative data to <i>classify</i> or <i>categorise</i> something, for example shirts as either small, medium or large.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Quantitative data</strong> are numbers. It is 30 degrees Celsius. The barometric pressure in Cape Town is 1017 hPa. We measured 45 mm of rain last night. Quantitative data can either be discreet or continuous.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Discreet</strong> data is a count and is measured in full numbers. For example 30 students enrolled for the Data Literacy workshop. We can't say 30.5 students enrolled. It has to be a full number and will either be 30 or 31, but nothing inbetween. 
      </li>
      <li><strong>Continuous data</strong> is numerical data that can take on any value in a certain range.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  Data can include a wide variety of artefacts including spreadsheets, documents, survey results, digitised texts or other artefacts, images, videos, models, measurements, much much more.
  
  Most projects will include more than one data type that often needs to be combined. A project may create data in a laboratory, that is processed, analysed and eventually will be represented in a spreadsheet or as graph in a report.
